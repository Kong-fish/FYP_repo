This is a Web-based Bank Loan Prediction Application that uses ensemble machine learning algorithms to improve its accuracy. The ensemble machine are implemented with a combination of 5 machine learning model which are CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest and Extra Trees using equally weighted soft voting method. The proposed system improves the decision-making of loan approvals and help reduced the banking manager’s administrative burden.
